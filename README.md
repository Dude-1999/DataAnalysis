30-day mortality rates plot for heart attack
The data for this assignment come from the Hospital Compare web site (http://hospitalcompare.hhs.gov)
run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The purpose of the web site is to provide data and
information about the quality of care at over 4,000 Medicare-certified hospitals in the U.S. This dataset essentially
covers all major U.S. hospitals. This dataset is used for a variety of purposes, including determining
whether hospitals should be fined for not providing high quality care to patients
